# chatbot-profile
A friendly, multilingual chatbot that represents me, Ratapakorn Linsa-nguan. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can answer common questions about my background, education, skills, and projects â€” in both English and Thai. The chatbot runs entirely client-side, uses lightweight NLP with Compromise.js for natural language understanding.
