# 🤖 Personal Chatbot – RatapakornBot

Welcome to my personal chatbot project — a fully client-side web chatbot that introduces **me**, Ratapakorn Linsa-nguan. It’s designed to answer questions about my background, projects, skills, and interests — in both **English and Thai** 🇬🇧 🇹🇭.

You can ask things like:
- "What do you study?"
- "Tell me about your favorite project"
- "คุณเรียนที่ไหน"
- "สนใจเรื่องอะไรบ้าง"

2. English input is normalized using NLP to improve fuzzy intent recognition.
3. Thai input is matched using basic pattern detection and keyword lookup.
4. If the bot doesn't understand, it responds with fallback messages.
